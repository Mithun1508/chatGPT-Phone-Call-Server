## Introduction
The ChatGPT Phone Call Server project aims to bridge the gap between traditional text-based chatbots and real-time voice interactions. By leveraging the capabilities of Twilio and Vocode, users can engage in natural conversations with ChatGPT over the phone, allowing for a seamless and immersive experience.

## Getting Started
To get started with the ChatGPT Phone Call Server, follow these simple steps:

1 Create a Twilio Account: Sign up for a Twilio account and obtain your account credentials.
2 Configure a Phone Number: From the Twilio dashboard, acquire a phone number and configure its Webhook URL to point to your server.
3 Obtain a Vocode API Key: Sign up for a Vocode account and obtain an API key.
4 Set Environment Variables: Set up the necessary environment variables for your server, including Twilio credentials and the Vocode API key.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

`main.py`: The main Python script responsible for handling incoming calls and processing voice data.
`pyproject.toml`: The Poetry project file for managing dependencies.
Other configuration and setup files.

## Environment Setup
Ensure that the following environment variables are properly configured:

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID: Your Twilio account SID.
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN: Your Twilio authentication token.
VOCODE_API_KEY: Your Vocode API key.

## Integration with Twilio
The ChatGPT Phone Call Server integrates seamlessly with Twilio to handle incoming phone calls. When a call is received, Twilio sends a webhook request to the server, which then processes the request and interacts with ChatGPT accordingly. Twilio's powerful API makes it easy to manage calls and handle voice data.

## Integration with Vocode
Vocode plays a crucial role in enhancing the voice processing capabilities of the ChatGPT Phone Call Server. By leveraging Vocode's advanced voice processing technology, the server can accurately transcribe and analyze speech, enabling more natural and intuitive interactions with ChatGPT.
